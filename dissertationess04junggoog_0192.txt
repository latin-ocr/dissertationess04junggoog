opere citato, The holy Roman empire. Quamvis in multis laudet Leo-
nem ΙΙΙ. et Carolum M.‚ tamen contendit, illegalgm fuisse illum actum
coronationis Caroli et erectionis Imperii Romani. Haud renovatum
fuisse asserit illud Imperium occidentale quod v. 476 sub Romulo Augu·
stulo interierat, sed Imperio CPtanO, ac si post mortem Constantini VI„
regnante muliere Irene, vacaret, substitutum et oppositum fuisse uni-
cum Immrium Romanum. ’ Inter alia haec habet: „Both the extinction
of the Western Empire in that year (476) and its revival in A. D.
800 have been very generally misunderstood in modern times, and
although the mistake is not, in a certain sense, of practical importance,
yet it tends to confuse history and to blind us to the ideas of the
people who acted on both occasions, When Odoacer compelled the
abdication of Romulus Augustulus, he did not abolish Western Em-
pire as a separate power, but caused it to be reunited with or sink
into the Eastern‚ so that from that time there was, as there had
been before Diocletian‚ a single undivided Roman Empire, In A. D.
800 the very memory of the separate Western Empire, as it had
stood from the death of Theodosius till Odoacer, had, so far as ap-
pearS, been long since lost, and neither Leo nor Charles nor any among
their advisers dreamt of reviving it. They too, like their prede-
cessom, held the Roman Empire to be one and indivisible, and pro·
posed by the coronation of the Frankish king not to proclaim a sever·
auce of the East and West, but to reverse the act of Constantine,
and make Old Rome again the civil as well as the ecclesiastical capital
of the Empire that bere her name. Their deed was in its essence
illegal‚ but they sought to give it every semblance of legality: they
professed and partly believed that they were not revolting against a
reigning sovereign, but legitimately filling up the place of the deposed
Constantine the Sixth3 the people of the imperial city exercising their
ancient right of choice‚ their bishop his right of consecration.“ L. c.
